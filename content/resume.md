### Thomas Coopman - Independent Software Consultant

Thomas Coopman has been fascinated with computers since he was a kid. Playing around at first, became programming later and after learning some programming for himself and a small detour starting studies for nursing, he went on and studied Master of Informatics at the KULeuven.

Thomas is a polyglot and loves to learn new languages. His latest language studies have taken him to Elixir, Elm, OCaml and he has a special affinity for functional programming languages.

Thomas is an independent software consultant, coach and architect focused on improving software through people. Thomas is also currently active in the DDD Belgium and Software Craftsmanship Belgium community.

- Architect

I started as senior developer on a ruby on rails project. I helped reducing accidental complexity in the code base and transformed the team from sprints to kanban.

After this I joined a different team on a C#(Event Sourcing/CQRS)/Javascript(React/Redux) project that was struggling to deliver. Here I started reducing the complexity in both the frontend and backend and also transformed this team to kanban. After a few months we went live with our first customers and started growing quickly. To support the grow we invested heavily in continuous deployment and continuous improvement.

During the whole time at Protime I was part of the architecture board where we discussed and guided architectural decisions. I also helped a transformation to feature teams so that more people were able to work on the same product. This transformation was both in architecture (microservices) and organisational.

#### Interests

**Hobby projects**:

In my spare time I always try to learn. I focus on things that are relevant on the job or things that will broaden my perspective. This ranges from new programming languages (Elm or OCaml) for example, to DDD, architecture of coaching. I try to focus on a broad aspect of things, and go deeper into detail where necessary.

On my [github](https://github.com/tcoopman) or [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) you can see some of these topics. On my github account you can also see that I try to participate in open source project and I'm also a maintainer for some small open source projects.

**Meetups and conferences**:

- Co-organiser of [DDD Belgium](https://www.meetup.com/dddbelgium/) and [Socrates Belgium](https://www.meetup.com/socratesbe/)
