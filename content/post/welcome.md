Welcome to the my new site written in [hugo](http://gohugo.io/).
While busy, I've set up https via letsencrypt. (see [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-14-04). You can find the source code of the blog [here](https://github.com/tcoopman/hugo-blog).
This is a reboot of my site, and an attempt to blog some more.

So without further ado, let's start blogging :)
