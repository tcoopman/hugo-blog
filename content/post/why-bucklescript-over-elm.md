On the meetups I attend, some people know me as the Elm guy. Now in the title of the post, you can see that I'm going for Bucklescript lately. Let me try to explain why I do this, but also let me say that this choice doesn't matter as much as a lot of people might think.

## What is Bucklescript

First of all, I'm assuming that you know what [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) is already. [Bucklescript](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html) on the other hand might be new to you.

This is what the manual says about Bucklescript:

  BuckleScript is a backend for the OCaml compiler which emits JavaScript. It works with both vanilla OCaml and Reason...

Let me try to recap this:

1. [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) is a functional programming language in the ML family (like for example Haskell and F#).
2. Bucklescript being a backend for the OCaml compiler means that you write OCaml and it get's compiled into Javascript.
3. [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/) is a new syntax for OCaml created by Facebook, you can see it as a dialect for OCaml (a bit similar to Elixir and Erlang)

So, you write OCaml code that get's transpiled to javascript. 

## Why Bucklescript over Elm

OCaml syntax is really close to Elm ()
Nice ecosystem. Nice guys
Ok tooling
Great interop
Not one way of doing, and more exploring yourself
It's growing fast and not one person has 


## Does this really matter?

No, because Elm is great and plus Don't like reason section on the manual
