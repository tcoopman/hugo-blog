My name is Thomas Coopman and I'm a 29 year old developer. Recently I've
officially started freelancing/consulting in my spare time. That's the main
reason for creating this site and blog.

On this site you can find some more information [about me](/about). At the
[portfolio](/portfolio) page you can see some things I've created. That page is
empty at the moment but it will be coming soon.

I'm a developer, mostly a web-developer (backend and frontend). In my main job,
I'm a project manager and developer. The main things I do is implementing
GIS systems and viewers, so I've got a lot of experience with GIS (mainly with
ArcGIS, but I also know Geoserver and leaflet).

If you need someone to help you with the implementation of a custom solution,
GIS or something else. You want to get a second opinion about something
technical. Or you need some help on a project...
contact me and we can have a chat!

Greetings

Thomas
