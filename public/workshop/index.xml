      <description>Starting with a some rabbling while reading the source of elixir eventstore
My original idea was to first start with some event storming and then go into programming. But I think it will be very important to have a very clear structure for this workshop so that everyone can follow. Not only that, it will also be very to have a why would you do that. When starting with event storming, maybe we are missing some basics.</description>

      <description>Update: changed the date to Thursday June 21st
Have you ever looked at Elixir and thought, this looks like a nice language with great features. This is a language that I want to know! Have you ever thought about toying with a raspberry pi or an arduino, playing with some leds, buttons, but never got around to it thinking it would take too much time to start with it. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re just interested in functional programming or you want to learn a new programming language?</description>
