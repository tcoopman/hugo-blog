<p>Well, that was a blast. <a href="https://dddeurope.com/2018/">DDD Europe 2018</a> is already over. And I loved it! Because I had lovely conversations, great insights and good learnings, I had the idea to create a summary, mostly for myself.</p>

<h2 id="pre-conference-workshop">Pre conference workshop</h2>

<h3 id="diy-event-sourcing-tooling">DIY Event Sourcing Tooling</h3>

<p>A pre conference workshop by Marijn Huizendveld on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>

<p>This workshop about making your own event sourcing tooling was not exactly what I expected it to be. Nevertheless I had some good insights during this workshop, not all related to the workshop exactly:</p>

<ul>
<li>I still amaze myself by how quickly I can delve to deep into code and get lost in a problem (this is not a good thing). I need to force myself to take a step back and take the time to look at the problem I&rsquo;m solving, why am I solving it,.. Maybe I should start thinking about using a very short pomodoro to force myself to stop and think.</li>
<li>We implemented a DSL for Commands/Events. It took a while to see where we were going with this but I found it interesting to do things in a completely different way because this can give you new insights.</li>
<li>We were asked to write 10 ideas down foor tooling, and Marijn forced us to think about it for a longer time than was comfortable. I like this technique to try to get new ideas. I&rsquo;m going to try this out myself on some problems. By setting a number you force yourself to think about it hard. It might be that all the ideas are junk, but maybe some of them are worth something.</li>
<li>I noticed that when doing a workshop like this, it&rsquo;s important that some of your teammates are really proficient in the programming language and the ecosystem or you can lose a lot of time with this.</li>
<li>A good heuristic I got from Marijn was when you have an idea, try it out for 2-4 hours and see if it&rsquo;s worth something. If you have a good code base, it is possible to do a lot in this very short time span.</li>
<li>Different experiences in a group is mostly a good thing, but it can also drag you down if the difference in experience in some domains is too big. In that kind of situation a part of the team will teach things to the other part. This is ofcourse a good thing as long as the people who teach are ok with this (maybe they want to get more out of the workshop).</li>
</ul>

<p>My final conclussion about the workshop itself is that I&rsquo;ve been really inspired by some simple tools and have some good ideas about good tooling in event sourcing. This is an area where there is a lot of room for good and simple tools or templates that you can implement in your code base.</p>

<h3 id="keynote-with-dave-snowden-https-dddeurope-com-2018-speakers-dave-snowden"><a href="https://dddeurope.com/2018/speakers/dave-snowden/">Keynote with Dave Snowden</a></h3>

<p>A great opening keynote of DDD Europe, one way too hard to summarize and a talk that I will certainly watch again once the videos are out.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sketchnotes_keynote_dave_snowden.jpg" alt="sketchnotes keynote dave snowden" /></p>

<h3 id="crossing-the-river-by-feeling-the-stones-https-dddeurope-com-2018-speakers-simon-wardley-talk"><a href="https://dddeurope.com/2018/speakers/simon-wardley/#talk">Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones</a></h3>

<p>By Simon Wardley.</p>

<p>Simon is a great speaker. This was an awesome talk about strategy! I tried making sketchnotes, but it didn&rsquo;t work. Simon presentend a huge number of slides and gets away with it. If you haven&rsquo;t seen this talk and you&rsquo;re interested in strategy, go watch it online as soon as it&rsquo;s out.</p>

<h3 id="from-legacy-chaos-to-the-promised-land-of-ddd-https-dddeurope-com-2018-speakers-anita-kvamme"><a href="https://dddeurope.com/2018/speakers/anita-kvamme">From Legacy Chaos to the Promised Land of DDD</a></h3>

<p>By Anita Kvamme and Ellen Lippe.</p>

<p>I wanted to attend this talk, but it was already fully booked, so I couldn&rsquo;t go. I noticed a couple of times that the blue room was full and that some people couldn&rsquo;t attend. I guess that&rsquo;s one of the really hard things for the organizers to plan this correctly. I&rsquo;m not sure if the problem can be solved. Luckely this room is also recorded, so I can watch the video later.</p>

<p>So I walked around for a small bit and got talking with <a href="https://twitter.com/thepaulrayner">Paul Rayner</a></p>
