      <description>On the meetups I attend, some people know me as the Elm guy. Yet, when reading the title of this post, you can see that I&amp;rsquo;m going for Bucklescript lately.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to explain my choice for Bucklescript. If you are in doubt, maybe some points in this post can help, but my advice would be to just try and research both languages and see for yourself.</description>

      <description>After reading the blog post of Mathias Verraes (@mathiasverraes) on (Type Safety and Money)[http://verraes.net/2016/02/type-safety-and-money/], and after doing a real short modelling attempt in Haskell at Socrates Belgium, I wanted to try to model Money in Elm.
I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go to deep and too far so I&amp;rsquo;ve set some basic constraints for myself:
 You cannot add money of different currencies (you need an explicit conversion) - Add constraint We also want a Price.</description>
