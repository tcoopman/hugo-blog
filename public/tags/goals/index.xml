      <description>The year is over, a new year has come.
I know, New Year is an arbitrary point in time but it is a tradition to look back on the past year and have some resolutions for the year to come.
So at this arbitrary point in time, lets look back and forward
2016 I&amp;rsquo;m going to make this short, because I mostly want to look forward!
 Became an independent software consultant Bought a house with my girlfriend Read lots of books Became a teamleader Lots of other cool stuff  2017 Last month I read Building Jarvis from Mark Zuckerberg where he builds himself a Jarvis in 100 hours.</description>
