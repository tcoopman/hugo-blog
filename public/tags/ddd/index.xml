      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;m exploring some ways of modelling aggregate boundaries in an event sourced system. This is mostly to crystallise some thoughts that I had after some event storming sessions, but it might be interesting to someone else.
The domain I&amp;rsquo;m using in this post is the domain that Michel Grootjans and I have created for the workshop Playing with projections (We already gave it a few times, for example at DDD Europe and will also give a session at I T.</description>

      <description>After reading the blog post of Mathias Verraes (@mathiasverraes) on (Type Safety and Money)[http://verraes.net/2016/02/type-safety-and-money/], and after doing a real short modelling attempt in Haskell at Socrates Belgium, I wanted to try to model Money in Elm.
I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go to deep and too far so I&amp;rsquo;ve set some basic constraints for myself:
 You cannot add money of different currencies (you need an explicit conversion) - Add constraint We also want a Price.</description>
