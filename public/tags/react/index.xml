      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my webpack workflow, and switched to 6to5, to be able to write more of my React code in ES6 than the current jsx transpiler supports (and because 6to5 just rocks!). You can find this workflow in my boilerplate-webpack-react project. Switching was easy. I&amp;rsquo;ve just replaced jsx-loader with 6to5-loader and everything worked correctly.
Writing code and developing is a breeze with this workflow, especially with react-hot-loader. I didn&amp;rsquo;t look into writing test though yet, and it took me a little while to find out how to do it, so I explain it here.</description>
