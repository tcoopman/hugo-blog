      <description>Elixir and Phoenix crossed my path multiple times last year. I read a really interesting tutorial on building a web framework from scratch. Furthermore, Phoenix is really popular as an Elm backend, so I decided it was time to dive a bit deeper and learn myself some Phoenix.
It just happens that Program Phoenix by by Chris McCord, Bruce Tate, and Jos√© Valim was published recently, so this seemed like a good opportunity to learn more!</description>
