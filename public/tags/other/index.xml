      <description>My name is Thomas Coopman and I&amp;rsquo;m a 29 year old developer. Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve officially started freelancing/consulting in my spare time. That&amp;rsquo;s the main reason for creating this site and blog.
On this site you can find some more information about me. At the portfolio page you can see some things I&amp;rsquo;ve created. That page is empty at the moment but it will be coming soon.
I&amp;rsquo;m a developer, mostly a web-developer (backend and frontend).</description>

      <description>This is not valid anymore. The site is build with hugo
This blogpost will be a about the why, but mostly about how I&amp;rsquo;ve created this site.
I&amp;rsquo;ve created this site mostly for these reasons:
 Make myself visible on the web. Practice my design and web-development skills. Practice my writing (blog). Record things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned for myself. Maybe someone else will find something useful here.  Content The contents of this site contain information about me, to make me more visible on the web.</description>
