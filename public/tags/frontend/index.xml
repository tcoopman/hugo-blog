      <description>On the meetups I attend, some people know me as the Elm guy. Yet, when reading the title of this post, you can see that I&amp;rsquo;m going for Bucklescript lately.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to explain my choice for Bucklescript. If you are in doubt, maybe some points in this post can help, but my advice would be to just try and research both languages and see for yourself.</description>

      <title>A big ball of frontend</title>

      <description>Tonight I&amp;rsquo;m giving a talk at Fronteers about Frontend microservices. Mind you, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go into what a microservice is, so a talk about Frontend services is fine as well.
What is important for me is that we&amp;rsquo;re not building a big ball of frontend. We&amp;rsquo;re paying so much attention to having a good architecture on the backend, with lots of (micro)services but at the same time, we&amp;rsquo;re building one huge single page application (SPA).</description>
