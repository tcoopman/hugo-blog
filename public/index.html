        <p>I think it was somewhere last year that I felt some pain in some of the fingers of my right hand for the first time. Mostly my thumb and pink felt unconfortable. Around the same period I also felt some pain in my right shoulder. It wasn&rsquo;t exactly at the same time but I found it a little disturbing knowing that as a developper these are things to watch out for. <a class="read-more" href="/blog/2019/04/06/the-ergodox-ez-keyboard/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Update: changed the date to Thursday June 21st
Have you ever looked at Elixir and thought, this looks like a nice language with great features. This is a language that I want to know! Have you ever thought about toying with a raspberry pi or an arduino, playing with some leds, buttons, but never got around to it thinking it would take too much time to start with it. Maybe you&rsquo;re just interested in functional programming or you want to learn a new programming language? <a class="read-more" href="/workshop/elixir-and-nerves-beginner-workshop/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>On the meetups I attend, some people know me as the Elm guy. Yet, when reading the title of this post, you can see that I&rsquo;m going for Bucklescript lately.
In this post I&rsquo;m going to try to explain my choice for Bucklescript. If you are in doubt, maybe some points in this post can help, but my advice would be to just try and research both languages and see for yourself. <a class="read-more" href="/blog/2017/10/28/why-i-choose-bucklescript/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Recently I&rsquo;ve started using Bucklescript (and Reason) over Elm for various reasons (Something I might blog about later). In this post I&rsquo;m exploring integrating Bucklescript with Typescript.
Let&rsquo;s start with a blank typescript project with webpack You can find the inital commit of a Typescript project here.
There is nothing special in this commit, some npm dependencies: source-map-loader, ts-loader, typescript, webpack, webpack-dev-server. The ts-config.json file is generated with tsc --init, nothing is changed. <a class="read-more" href="/blog/2017/09/30/integrating-bucklescript-with-typescript/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Tonight I&rsquo;m giving a talk at Fronteers about Frontend microservices. Mind you, I don&rsquo;t want to go into what a microservice is, so a talk about Frontend services is fine as well.
What is important for me is that we&rsquo;re not building a big ball of frontend. We&rsquo;re paying so much attention to having a good architecture on the backend, with lots of (micro)services but at the same time, we&rsquo;re building one huge single page application (SPA). <a class="read-more" href="/blog/2017/09/27/a-big-ball-of-frontend/">&raquo;</a></p>
